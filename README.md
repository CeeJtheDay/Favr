# Online-Marketplace

## Description

In this project, I am going to create an online market template using the third side API. Especially in this project, I create it especially for Best Buy. So the user can view bestbuy products, add to the cart and place order. For this project, I am going to build such a **React CRUD** application with **MERN Stack** Technique.

Here is how the application made of:
* UI: **React**

* Backend: **Node**, **Express** 
* API: **BestBuy API**
