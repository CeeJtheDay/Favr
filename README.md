## Description

This application is an online platform that allows users to source and trade services with other users.  Upon joining the application, users will create a profile.  In the profile, the user will add “wants” and “services” to their profile, and be entered into the database.  Once a user profile has been created, a user can search through a sorted list of other users whose services match their needs, or vice versa.   Once a user finds a match whose needs and services are aligned, they can select to chat with this user and strike up a deal, or view their profile. 

This application uses the MERN stack of technologies, and is designed to be a mobile only application.

* Frontend:
    * React.js
    * Material UI
